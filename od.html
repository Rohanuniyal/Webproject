    <p style="color: aqua;">
        Nestled in the mountain ranges of the Himalayas, Dehradun is one of the most beautiful cities in the sub mountain tracks of India, known for its scenic surroundings. The name Dehradun is a collection of two words “dera” meaning camp and “dun” meaning valley.

        It is also known as one of the oldest cities in India, it is believed that Lord Rama and his brother did penance here for killing Ravana, the demon king. 
        
        Under the British, Dehradun became an elite town with many a fine institution like Forest Research Institute, Doon School and Welham Schools for girls and boys, many more, like the ONGC and Wadia Institute of Himalayan Studies, were added in time. Dehradun has now become an important tourist destination.
