    <h2 style="text-align: center;">OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p style="color: aqua;">
        At an average height of 2800 meters, Auli in the Indian state of Uttarakhand is renowned for the fascinating ski resorts and stunning natural vistas. Bounded by the snowy peaks of the mighty Himalayas, this hilly terrain offers the sceneries of oak fringed slopes, coniferous forests, apple orchards and fine deodar trees and spectacular views of the lofty mountain ranges like Nanda Devi, Mana Paravat and Kamat Kamet.

        Auli proffers a credible past that dates back to the 8th century blessed with the sacred visit of Sankaracharya. Aptly called as the haven for skiing activities, the harsh frosty storms, the sylvan peaks and the long stretch of snowy valleys would make idyllic surroundings for a skier.
        
        The former training ground of the Indo-Tibetan Police Force, Auli has gained the status of a popular hill resort within a short span of time because it is bestowed with all that is enough to thrill the onlookers. The nature at its full bloom gives a feeling of an awe inspiring time, which cannot be wiped out from our wildest dreams.
